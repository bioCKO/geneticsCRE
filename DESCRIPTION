Description: geneticsCRE is an R package that performs genome-wide association study pathway anaysis (GWASPA) to
             identify statistically significant associations between variants on a gene regulatory pathways 
             and a given phenotype. Unlike Genome-wide association study (GWAS), that seeks to assign 
             statistical significance to associations of variations in single genes to a  phenotype, GWASPA
             accumulates statistical power by examining rare variant along gene-gene interaction pathways.
             GWASPA  uses prior causal information a gene regulatory interactions to infer statistically 
             significant associations between causal pathways and a the phenotype. Given phenotype data with
             case/control information, geneticsCRE computes GWASPA for all valid pathways as identified by the
             Homo Sapien STRINGdb causal network. Examples on usage are provided in the vignette.
